NexHax Counterfeit Drug Detection Tool 

This project addresses SDG Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, by combating the threats of counterfeited medicine that puts patients and the healthcare system at risk. Counterfeited medication can be very harmful- from contamination to over/under dosage and containing misleading drugs.Using a Convolutional Neural Network for binary classification, it distinguishes genuine and counterfeit drug images, achieving over a 90% accuracy and F1 score. This tool can be beneficial for more vulnerable lower resourced areas and can act as a preliminary system for checking large batches of medications.
